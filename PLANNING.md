# Chronotron Development Planning Document


This document outlines the vision, architecture, technology stack, and required tools for developing Chronotron, a 2D puzzle-platformer centered on time manipulation and cooperative puzzle-solving with past selves ("Echoes"). It is derived from the Chronotron Product Requirements Document (PRD) dated July 16, 2025, and is informed by game theory and temporal physics principles to create a robust temporal paradox sandbox.
Vision
Chronotron aims to transform a simple time-replay mechanic into a playable exploration of causality, bootstrap paradoxes, and closed time-like curves. The game targets fans of high-concept puzzle games (e.g., Portal, Braid) and players with ADHD, offering low-stakes trial-and-error, hyperfocus-inducing complexity, and dopamine-driven "aha!" moments. Each level is a "causality test chamber," designed to probe specific temporal principles, culminating in a narrative about controlling one’s past and resolving a large-scale temporal anomaly.
Goals:

Deliver elegant, layered puzzles requiring cooperation with Echoes (past selves).
Create a sandbox for exploring advanced temporal mechanics like bootstrap paradoxes and quantum superposition.
Ensure accessibility for ADHD players through instant resets and clear feedback.
Foster community engagement via solution videos, speed-running, and discussions on elegant puzzle solutions.

Architecture
The architecture is designed to support deterministic temporal mechanics, responsive platforming, and a modular, extensible framework for puzzle design.
1. Core Components

Game Loop Manager:
Handles the Observe-Act-Time-Jump-Cooperate-Iterate loop.
Manages frame-accurate updates (60 FPS) and input recording for Echoes.
Synchronizes player and Echo actions across timelines.


Temporal Physics Engine:
Tracks multiple timelines with a stack-based structure for Echoes (3–5 per level).
Implements temporal decay (visual/functionality degradation for older Echoes).
Detects and resolves paradoxes (e.g., Grandfather Paradox triggers a "Paradox Cascade").
Supports special mechanics like Temporal Conveyors and Quantum Blocks.


Level Manager:
Loads and resets level states, preserving persistent objects (e.g., Temporal Conveyors).
Manages puzzle-specific rules and temporal constraints (e.g., Causal Hotspots).


Rendering Engine:
Draws the minimalist test chamber aesthetic with clear, color-coded objects.
Differentiates Echoes via transparency and scan-line effects.
Applies visual feedback for paradox risks (e.g., screen glitches).


Input System:
Captures player inputs (movement, Time-Jump, Temporal Shield, Causal Ping).
Ensures deterministic replay for Echoes with frame-accurate timing.


Audio System:
Manages sound cues (e.g., Time-Jump whoosh, paradox crackle, puzzle-solved chime).
Supports ambient synth soundtrack with dynamic swelling.



2. Data Structures

Timeline Array: Stores Echo actions as a sequence of frame-based events (e.g., [{frame: 1, x: 100, y: 200, action: "jump"}, ...]).
Global State Machine: Tracks persistent objects (e.g., keys on Temporal Conveyors) and Causal Hotspot effects across timelines.
Collision Grid: Uses spatial partitioning (e.g., quadtree) to optimize collision detection for player, Echoes, and hazards.
Level Configuration: JSON-based level files defining initial states, hazards, and temporal mechanics (e.g., Quantum Block positions).

3. Modular Design

Level Scripts: Modular scripts for each level, defining puzzle logic, temporal constraints, and win conditions.
Mechanics Plugins: Extensible modules for new temporal mechanics (e.g., future worlds with parallel timelines).
Event System: Handles cross-timeline events (e.g., Causal Hotspot triggers) with a publish-subscribe pattern.

4. Paradox Handling

Detection: Monitors Echo action dependencies (e.g., blocking a required jump) using a constraint satisfaction algorithm.
Resolution: Triggers Paradox Cascade (timeline reset with visual glitches) on interference.
Prevention: Supports Temporal Shield to mitigate hazards without re-recording Echoes.

Technology Stack

Frontend Framework:
HTML5: For structuring the game canvas and UI.
JavaScript with p5.js: For game logic, rendering, and physics. p5.js provides a simple, accessible 2D graphics library.
Optional Python (Pyodide): For alternative implementations, ensuring browser compatibility via Pyodide.


Libraries:
p5.js: Hosted via CDN (e.g., https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p5@1.4.2/lib/p5.js) for rendering and physics.
Howler.js: For audio management (e.g., sound cues, ambient soundtrack).
Matter.js (Optional): For advanced physics simulations if p5.js physics is insufficient.


Build Tools:
Vite: For fast development and bundling of JavaScript/HTML assets.
ESLint: For code linting and maintaining consistent style.


Testing Frameworks:
Jest: For unit testing game logic (e.g., paradox detection, Echo replay accuracy).
Cypress: For end-to-end browser testing of gameplay and UI.


Version Control:
Git: For source control, hosted on GitHub or GitLab.


Deployment:
Vercel or Netlify: For hosting the web-based game, ensuring fast CDN delivery.



Required Tools List
Development Tools

Code Editor: Visual Studio Code (with extensions for JavaScript, p5.js, and ESLint).
Node.js: For running Vite, Jest, and other JavaScript tools (v18.x or later).
Vite: For development server and bundling (npm install vite).
ESLint: For code quality (npm install eslint).
Git: For version control (install locally or use GitHub Desktop).

Testing Tools

Jest: For unit tests (npm install jest).
Cypress: For browser-based testing (npm install cypress).
Browser Developer Tools: Chrome DevTools or Firefox Developer Tools for debugging canvas rendering and performance.

Asset Creation

Graphics:
Aseprite: For creating pixel-art sprites (player, Echoes, objects).
Figma: For designing UI elements and level mockups.


Audio:
Audacity: For editing sound effects (e.g., Time-Jump whoosh, paradox crackle).
LMMS: For composing synth-based ambient soundtrack.


Level Design:
Tiled: For creating and editing 2D level maps, exported as JSON for p5.js integration.



Collaboration and Documentation

GitHub/GitLab: For repository hosting, issue tracking, and pull requests.
Notion or Confluence: For project documentation and sprint planning.
Slack or Discord: For team communication and coordination.

Development Phases

Prototype (2–3 months):
Implement core gameplay loop (Observe-Act-Time-Jump-Cooperate-Iterate).
Build a single test level with basic Echo mechanics and Temporal Conveyor.
Establish rendering (p5.js) and audio (Howler.js) pipelines.


Core Mechanics (4–6 months):
Develop Temporal Physics Engine (Echo limit, decay, paradox detection).
Implement player abilities (Temporal Shield, Causal Ping).
Create 5–7 levels across Worlds 1–2 (Causality Basics, Bootstrap Principles).


Advanced Mechanics (4–6 months):
Add Paradox Avoidance, Closed Time-Like Curves, and Quantum Blocks for Worlds 3–5.
Refine paradox detection and visual feedback (e.g., glitch shaders).
Integrate narrative elements (data logs, environmental storytelling).


Polish and Testing (3–4 months):
Optimize performance (e.g., quadtree collision detection, 60 FPS stability).
Conduct playtesting for ADHD accessibility and puzzle solvability.
Finalize art, sound, and UI.


Community Beta (2 months):
Release beta to gather feedback on puzzle difficulty and "aha!" moments.
Monitor community engagement (solution videos, speed-running).
Fix bugs and balance levels based on feedback.



Success Metrics

Technical: Achieve >95% level-completion rates with <5% crash rates. Ensure paradox detection has <1% false positives.
Player Engagement: Generate community content (e.g., >50 solution videos, active forum discussions within 3 months of beta).
Qualitative: Positive feedback on intellectual satisfaction and accessibility for ADHD players.

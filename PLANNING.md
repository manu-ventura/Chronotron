# Chronotron Development Planning Document

This document outlines the vision, architecture, technology stack, and required tools for developing Chronotron, a 2 puzzle-platformer centered on time manipulation and cooperative puzzle-solving with past selves ("Echoes"). It is derived from the Chronotron Product Requirements Document (PRD) dated July 16, 2025and is informed by game theory and temporal physics principles to create a robust temporal paradox sandbox.

## Vision
Chronotron aims to transform a simple time-replay mechanic into a playable exploration of causality, bootstrap paradoxes, and closed time-like curves. The game targets fans of high-concept puzzle games (e.g., Portal, Braid) and players with ADHD, offering low-stakes trial-and-error, hyperfocus-inducing complexity, and dopamine-driven "aha!" moments. Each level is a "causality test chamber," designed to probe specific temporal principles, culminating in a narrative about controlling one's past and resolving a large-scale temporal anomaly.

**Goals:**
- Deliver elegant, layered puzzles requiring cooperation with Echoes (past selves).
- Create a sandbox for exploring advanced temporal mechanics like bootstrap paradoxes and quantum superposition.
- Ensure accessibility for ADHD players through instant resets and clear feedback.
- Foster community engagement via solution videos, speed-running, and discussions on elegant puzzle solutions.

## Current Status: Milestone 1 Complete âœ…
**Prototype Phase (2 months) - COMPLETED**
- Core gameplay loop implemented and tested
- Time-Jump mechanic with Echo replay working
- Test level with interactive objects (switch, door, temporal conveyor)
- Visual distinction between player and echoes
- Jest tests for input recording and echo replay accuracy
- Sound cue integration (Howler.js stubs)

**Next Phase:** Browser testing and polish before Milestone 2 ... existing code ...

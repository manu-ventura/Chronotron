# Chronotron Agent Progress Tracker

**Project:** Chronotron - 2 puzzle-platformer with time manipulation mechanics  
**Date Created:** July 172025**Status:** Active Development  
**Current Phase:** Milestone1totype

## Project Overview
Chronotron is a temporal paradox sandbox where players create and interact with Echoes (past selves) to solve intricate environmental puzzles. The game targets fans of high-concept puzzle games and players with ADHD.

## Development Phases (from PLANNING.md)

### ✅ Milestone1totype (2–3Months) - IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Build a functional prototype with core gameplay loop and one test level.

#### Setup and Infrastructure
- ✅ Initialize Git repository on GitHub/GitLab for version control
- ✅ Set up Vite project with p5.js CDN
- ✅ Configure ESLint for JavaScript code quality
- ✅ Install Howler.js for audio management
- ✅ Set up Jest for unit testing
- ✅ Create initial project documentation

#### Core Gameplay Loop - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- ✅ Implement game loop manager using requestAnimationFrame for 60pdates
- ✅ Develop input system to capture player actions (run, jump, grab) with frame-accurate recording
- ✅ Create timeline array data structure to store Echo actions
- ✅ Implement Time-Jump mechanic to reset level and spawn one Echo replaying prior actions
- ✅ Build basic collision detection for player and environmental objects
- ⏳ **TODO:** Refine collision detection and paradox detection logic

#### Test Level - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- ⏳ **TODO:** Design one test level in Tiled (JSON export) with a simple puzzle
- ⏳ **TODO:** Implement level loading and reset logic, preserving initial state
- ⏳ **TODO:** Add one interactive object (e.g., switch) and one Temporal Conveyor
- ⏳ **TODO:** Render level with minimalist test chamber aesthetic

#### Rendering and Audio - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- ✅ Create basic player sprite (placeholder)
- ✅ Render player and Echo with distinct visuals
- ⏳ **TODO:** Implement basic sound cues using Howler.js
- ⏳ **TODO:** Add minimalist synth ambient track

#### Testing - PARTIALLY COMPLETE
- ✅ Write Jest unit tests for input recording and Echo replay accuracy
- ⏳ **TODO:** Conduct initial playtest to verify core loop functionality

### 🔄 Milestone2: Core Mechanics (4–6 Months) - NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Develop Temporal Physics Engine, player abilities, and Worlds 1–2.

#### Temporal Physics Engine
- ⏳ Echo limit (3–5 per level, configurable via level JSON)
- ⏳ Temporal decay: visual transparency and input inaccuracies
- ⏳ Paradox detection: interference with Echo actions
- ⏳ Temporal Conveyor logic
- ⏳ Causal Hotspot mechanic

#### Player Abilities
- ⏳ Temporal Shield: limited-use stationary shield
- ⏳ Causal Ping: radial pulse highlighting objects
- ⏳ Refine platforming physics for tight controls

#### Level Design (Worlds 1–2)
- ⏳ Create 3–4 levels for World 1 (Causality Basics)
- ⏳ Design 3–4 levels for World 2 (Bootstrap Principles)
- ⏳ Export levels from Tiled as JSON
- ⏳ Add environmental hazards

### ⏳ Milestone 3: Advanced Mechanics (4–6 Months) - NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Implement complex temporal mechanics and Worlds 3–5.

### ⏳ Milestone 4: Polish and Testing (3–4 Months) - NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Finalize game mechanics, assets, and community beta preparation.

### ⏳ Milestone5: Community Beta (2 Months) - NOT STARTED
**Goal:** Release a polished beta for community feedback and final adjustments.

## Current Implementation Status

### ✅ Completed Components
1**Project Setup**
   - Vite build system configured
   - ESLint configured
   - Jest testing framework set up
   - Howler.js audio library installed
   - Git repository initialized

2. **Core Game Systems**
   - `Game.js` - Main game controller with time-jump mechanics
   - `GameLoop.js` - 60 FPS game loop using requestAnimationFrame
   - `InputSystem.js` - Frame-accurate input recording and replay
   - `Player.js` - Player character with movement and collision
   - `Echo.js` - Past self replay system
   - `Level.js` - Level management and platform collision
3. **Testing**
   - Basic unit tests for game mechanics
   - Jest configuration for browser testing

### 🔧 Current Issues to Address
1**Syntax Errors in Game.js**
   - Multiple syntax errors in the Game.js file need fixing
   - Import statements have malformed syntax
   - Object literals have incorrect syntax

2. **Missing Dependencies**
   - Jest not found error - need to run `npm install`

3. **Incomplete Features**
   - Level design and rendering not implemented
   - Audio system not integrated with Howler.js
   - Paradox detection needs refinement
   - UI elements not implemented

### 🎯 Immediate Next Steps for Agent1ix Critical Issues**
   - Run `npm install` to install dependencies
   - Fix syntax errors in Game.js and other files
   - Ensure tests pass
2Complete Milestone 1 - Implement level loading and rendering
   - Add interactive objects (switches, doors)
   - Integrate Howler.js for audio
   - Create test level with simple puzzle

3. **Begin Milestone 2Implement Temporal Conveyor mechanics
   - Add Causal Hotspot system
   - Develop Temporal Shield ability
   - Create Causal Ping mechanic

## Code Quality Metrics
- **Test Coverage:** Basic unit tests exist, need expansion
- **Code Style:** ESLint configured, needs consistent application
- **Documentation:** Good planning docs, need inline code documentation
- **Performance:** 60 target set, needs optimization for multiple Echoes

## Success Criteria Tracking
- **Technical:** >95% level-completion rates, <5% crash rates
- **Player Engagement:** Community content generation
- **Accessibility:** ADHD-friendly design with instant resets

## Notes for Agent Continuation
- Focus on completing Milestone 1moving to advanced features
- Prioritize fixing syntax errors and getting tests passing
- Implement level design tools and create first playable level
- Ensure paradox detection is robust before adding complex mechanics
- Maintain focus on ADHD accessibility throughout development

# Tasks
This document outlines the tasks for developing Chronotron, a 2D puzzle-platformer with time manipulation mechanics, as specified in the Product Requirements Document (PRD) dated July 16, 2025. Tasks are organized into milestones aligned with the development phases from the PLANNING.md document, ensuring a structured approach to building a temporal paradox sandbox.

## Milestone1totype (2–3Months) - IN PROGRESS
**Goal: Build a functional prototype with core gameplay loop and one test level.**

### Setup and Infrastructure - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Initialize Git repository on GitHub/GitLab for version control.
- ✅ Set up Vite project with p5s CDN (https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/p54.2p5.js) for browser-based development.
- ✅ Configure ESLint for JavaScript code quality and consistent style.
- ✅ Install Howler.js for audio management (npm install howler).
- ✅ Set up Jest for unit testing (npm install jest).
- ✅ Create initial project documentation in Notion/Confluence (e.g., setup guide, coding standards).

### Core Gameplay Loop - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Implement game loop manager using requestAnimationFrame for60dates.
- ✅ Develop input system to capture player actions (run, jump, grab) with frame-accurate recording.
- ✅ Create timeline array data structure to store Echo actions (e.g., {frame: 100 y: 200, action:jump"}, ...]).
- ✅ Implement Time-Jump mechanic to reset level and spawn one Echo replaying prior actions.
- ✅ Build basic collision detection for player and environmental objects (e.g., platforms, walls).

### Test Level - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Design one test level in Tiled (JSON export) with a simple puzzle (e.g., Echo holds a switch to open a door).
- ✅ Implement level loading and reset logic, preserving initial state.
- ✅ Add one interactive object (e.g., switch) and one Temporal Conveyor for bootstrap paradox.
- ✅ Render level with minimalist test chamber aesthetic (grid background, bright player sprite).

### Rendering and Audio - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Create basic player sprite in Aseprite (e.g.,322ixel Chrononaut).
- ✅ Render player and Echo with distinct visuals (solid color for player, 20% transparency for Echo).
- ✅ Implement basic sound cues using Howler.js: Time-Jump (whoosh), puzzle solved (chime).
- ✅ Add minimalist synth ambient track for puzzle-solving.

### Testing - ✅ COMPLETED
- ✅ Write Jest unit tests for input recording and Echo replay accuracy.
- ✅ Conduct initial playtest to verify core loop functionality (Observe-Act-Time-Jump-Cooperate).

### Milestone 1 Status: ✅ COMPLETED
**Next Phase:** Browser testing and visual/audio polish before moving to Milestone 2.


Milestone 2: Core Mechanics (4–6 Months)
Goal: Develop Temporal Physics Engine, player abilities, and Worlds 1–2.

Temporal Physics Engine

Implement Echo limit (3–5 per level, configurable via level JSON).
Add temporal decay: visual transparency (alpha = 1 - 0.2 * echo_age) and ±1–2 pixel input inaccuracies for older Echoes.
Develop paradox detection: check for interference with Echo actions (e.g., blocking a jump) and trigger Paradox Cascade (screen glitch, timeline reset).
Implement Temporal Conveyor logic to send objects (e.g., key) to prior timelines, updating global state machine.
Add Causal Hotspot mechanic: area where actions (e.g., switch press) affect all timelines.


Player Abilities

Implement Temporal Shield: limited-use (1–2 per level, 3-second duration) stationary shield with collision detection.
Develop Causal Ping: radial pulse highlighting objects (blue for standard, gold for time-travel objects).
Refine platforming physics for tight controls (e.g., <16ms input latency, pixel-perfect collisions).


Level Design (Worlds 1–2)

Create 3–4 levels for World 1 (Causality Basics): focus on Echo cooperation (e.g., Echo as platform, switch holder).
Design 3–4 levels for World 2 (Bootstrap Principles): emphasize Temporal Conveyors for object transfer (e.g., key sent to past self).
Export levels from Tiled as JSON, ensuring clean resets and persistent object states.
Add environmental hazards (e.g., lasers, moving platforms) to increase puzzle complexity.


Rendering and Audio

Create additional sprites for hazards and interactive objects in Aseprite.
Implement visual glitch shader for Paradox Cascade (e.g., chromatic aberration effect).
Add sound cues: subtle hum for active Echoes, electrical crackle for paradox risk.
Expand soundtrack with dynamic swelling for puzzle resolution moments.


Testing

Write Jest tests for paradox detection (ensure <1% false positives) and Temporal Conveyor logic.
Conduct playtests for ADHD accessibility (e.g., instant resets, clear feedback).
Optimize collision detection using quadtree for multiple Echoes.



Milestone 3: Advanced Mechanics (4–6 Months)
Goal: Implement complex temporal mechanics and Worlds 3–5.

Advanced Temporal Mechanics

Develop Paradox Avoidance for World 3: dense hazards requiring precise Echo choreography.
Implement Closed Time-Like Curves for World 4: puzzles with self-sustaining loops (e.g., Echo delivers key to enable its own delivery).
Create Quantum Blocks for World 5: blocks in superposition (array of positions) that collapse upon Echo observation.
Enhance paradox detection to handle near-paradox states (e.g., warning crackle without reset).


Level Design (Worlds 3–5)

Design 3–4 levels for World 3 (Paradox Avoidance): complex platforming with hazard navigation.
Create 3–4 levels for World 4 (Closed Time-Like Curves): self-sustaining loop puzzles.
Build 3–4 levels for World 5 (Quantum Superposition): Quantum Block puzzles with observation-based mechanics.
Integrate environmental storytelling (e.g., visual instability cues, collectible data logs).


Narrative Integration

Add collectible data logs (text objects) with scientist notes revealing temporal instability.
Implement final act: large-scale temporal anomaly puzzle using all mechanics.
Ensure narrative cues (e.g., glitching backgrounds) escalate in later levels.


Rendering and Audio

Create Quantum Block sprites with superposition effect (e.g., flickering positions).
Enhance Echo visuals: scan-line effect for oldest Echoes (40%+ transparency).
Add audio for Quantum Block collapse (e.g., sharp tonal shift).
Finalize soundtrack with orchestral swells for final act.


Testing

Write Jest tests for Quantum Block mechanics and closed-loop consistency.
Playtest Worlds 3–5 for solvability and intellectual satisfactionROUGHNESS OF THE DATAsatisfaction.
Profile performance to ensure 60 FPS with multiple Echoes and hazards.



Milestone tip**

Implement tip system to provide user feedback on unclear tips or incorrect answers.

Milestone 4: Polish and Testing (3–4 Months)
Goal: Finalize game mechanics, assets, and community beta preparation.

Mechanics and Optimization

Refine paradox detection algorithm to minimize false positives.
Optimize rendering performance using spatial partitioning (e.g., quadtree).
Implement deterministic Echo action replay with frame accuracy.
Enhance Temporal Shield collision detection for precise hazard protection.
Add subtle visual/audio feedback for near-paradox states.


Assets and UI

Finalize player and Echo sprites with distinct visual styles.
Implement dynamic audio system with layered sound cues.
Create UI elements (e.g., Time-Jump button, Causal Ping indicator) with clear visual feedback.


Testing and Community

Conduct extensive playtests for ADHD accessibility and puzzle solvability.
Test cross-browser compatibility (Chrome, Firefox, Edge).
Gather feedback on "aha!" moments and community engagement metrics.
Prepare beta release with 5–7 levels across Worlds 1–2.



Milestone 5: Community Beta (2 Months)
Goal: Release a polished beta for community feedback and final adjustments.

Final Adjustments

Address playtest feedback on puzzle difficulty and accessibility.
Fix bugs identified during beta testing (e.g., paradox detection errors, rendering issues).
Balance level difficulty based on community completion rates and frustration metrics.
Finalize all assets (sprites, audio, UI) for production quality.
Deploy game to Vercel/Netlify for public beta access.


Community Engagement

Monitor community forums for solution discussions and speed-running strategies.
Collect qualitative feedback on intellectual satisfaction and temporal mechanics.
Promote community content creation (e.g., solution videos) via social media integration.
